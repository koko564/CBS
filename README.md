# Malnutrition in Indian Children
This is an app made with Streamlit that visualizes the dire situation of malnutrition in children in India.
It also provides a macro calculator so that parents can make an informed decision on their child's nutritional requirements.

Our project uses the data publicly available at http://rchiips.org/NFHS/districtfactsheet_NFHS-5.shtml.
